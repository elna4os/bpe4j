# BPE (byte pair encoding) tokenization for Java

Some points:
1. Basic implementation (no dropout or other enhancements)
2. Based on Stream API ([Collection.parallelStream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html#parallelStream--) operation)
3. Number of threads is controlled by JVM
4. Parallel processing is used only for learning
5. Tokenization is not implemented

To do:
1. Add ability to set number of threads
2. Implement tokenization
